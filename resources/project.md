# Final Project 

The final project offers you an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques on a problem that _you_ care about beyond the scope of homeworks. It also helps you practice a diverse set of skills, including working in a team and providing constructive feedback.

# Timeline 

- **Project Brainstorming**: Jan 17th -- starting from the first day, getting yourself in ML mode 
- **Group Formation Due**: Feb 2nd   
- **Project Proposal Due**: Mar 2nd 
- **Project Pitches**: Mar 5th 
- **Peer Pitch Feedback Due**: Mar 12th  
- **Midpoint Spotlight Due**: Apr 6th  
- **Peer Spotlight Feedback Due**: Apr 11th  
- **Final Project Poster Session**: May 2nd  
- **Final Project Report**: May 4th  

# Project Brainstorming 

We will use Piazza and office hours heavily to discuss final project ideas. Please use `#project_ideas` to tag corresponding posts on Piazza. Course staff will offer feedback to these posts.

A good project should 

- be an interesting well-motivated problem;
- have readily available data, or a clear plan to gather the dataset by March 15th;
- can be formulated or partially addressed with machine learning techniques;
- have a solution (ideally multiple solutions) that you can implement within the scope of this class.

# Groups 

You must form a group of 4-5 students enrolled in this course and make a post on Piazza with your names (use `project_groups` to tag the post) by 11:59pm on Feb 2nd. Participation in brainstorming project ideas is a great way to find other students with similar interests. It is important to convince your peers that your idea has merit both in academia and in industry.

# Final Project Proposal 

Each group will submit a proposal of **at most** two pages and a presentation of **at most** three slides by 11:59pm on Mar 2nd on Moodle.  In addition, each group will make a single post on Piazza attaching their slides and proposal using the tag `project_pitches`. Finally, each group will make a presentation of three minutes in class on Mar 5th.

A good proposal should

- explain why the project is worth studying;
- explain why machine learning techniques are appropriate;
- demonstrate that you (will) have access to datasets;
- present initial thoughts of possible approaches.

# Peer Feedback for Project Proposal

Each student will provide feedback to one project from other groups in the Follow-up Discussion section of the associated Piazza post by 11:59pm on Oct 25. The feedback should use the following template:

- What I like about this proposal
- What I would have done differently (practical constructive feedback for improvements)
- What I wish that this project can achieve with unlimited resources (moonshot ideas)

Your feedback will be evaluated based on whether it is clear and constructive.

# Midpoint Spotlight

Prepare at most three slides to describe

- What you have done so far
- What kind of advice that you are seeking.

Due to limited time, you will post your slides on Piazza using the tag 'project_spotlight' rather than giving a formal presentation. 

# Midpoint Peer Feedback

Each student will provide feedback to one projects from other groups on Piazza by 11:59pm on Apr 11th. The feedback should use the following template:

- What I like about the current progress
- What I would improve over what has been done
- What I would try in the next three weeks

Your feedback will be evaluated based on whether it is clear and constructive.
